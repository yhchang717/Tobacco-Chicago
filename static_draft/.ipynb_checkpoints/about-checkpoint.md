# Understanding Tobacco Use in the United States

Yi-Huai Chang

## What is your current goal? Has it changed since the proposal?

The current goal of the project remains aligned with the original proposal, which is to explore patterns of tobacco and vape use across demographic groups and over time. However, since access to the Healthy Chicago Survey was not possible, I have shifted the focus to using data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). The broader goal is to capture the general trends in tobacco use in the United States, identifying high-risk populations and understanding how usage patterns have evolved over time.

## Are there data challenges you are facing? Are you currently depending on mock data?

One of the challenges has been adjusting the scope of the project due to the lack of access to data from the Healthy Chicago Survey. While NSDUH offers valuable insights into national patterns, it lacks the geographic data that would allow for neighborhood-specific analysis. As a result, Iâ€™ve shifted focus to demographic factors such as age, income, race, and gender, as well as temporal trends. I am currently working with real data from the NSDUH, and no mock data are being used.

## Describe each of the provided images with 2-3 sentences to give the context and how it relates to your goal.

### 1. Ever Smoked Cigarette by Year:

This bar chart presents the trend in the percentage of people who have ever smoked cigarettes from 2015 to 2021. The downward trend aligns with the goal of understanding long-term changes in smoking behaviors, reflecting successful public health initiatives over time.

### 2. Average Age When First Smoked Cigarette by Gender:

This line chart demonstrates the average age at which individuals first smoked a cigarette, broken down by gender from 2015 to 2021. The stability in the age of initiation across genders underscores the need for early interventions to delay the age of first tobacco use.

### 3. Proportion of Ever Used vs Never Used for Cigarettes and Vape by Year (2020 vs 2021):

This pie chart illustrates the proportion of individuals who have ever used cigarettes (CIGEVER) and vape products (VAPANYEVR) in 2020 and 2021. It shows a slight increase in vape use from 2020 to 2021, aligning with the goal of understanding the rise of vaping, particularly among younger demographics.

### 4. Percentage of Current Smokers by Race:

This bar chart shows the percentage of current smokers across various racial groups. It reveals that Native American/Alaska Native populations have the highest smoking rates, an important finding for addressing racial disparities in tobacco use.

### 5. Cigarette Use Distribution by Age Group (Violin Plot):

This violin plot visualizes the distribution of cigarette use across age groups, showing both light and heavy smoking patterns within each demographic. This chart provides a detailed view of how smoking behavior differs by age, aiding in demographic analysis.
Percentage of Ever Use of Cigarettes, Smokeless Tobacco, Cigars, and Pipes by Year:

### 6.Cigarette Use Distribution by Age Group (stacked bar):

This stacked bar chart highlights the distribution of cigarette use across various age groups, categorized by the number of cigarettes smoked per day. The chart helps identify age groups with higher smoking frequencies, contributing to the identification of high-risk populations for targeted interventions.

### 7.Percentage of Ever Use of Cigarettes, Smokeless Tobacco, Cigars, and Pipes by Year:
This line chart tracks the percentage of ever use of different tobacco products, showing a declining trend in cigarette use over time. Alternative tobacco products, like cigars and smokeless tobacco, show stable or slightly decreasing trends. 

### 8.Heatmap of Income vs Cigarette Use (Days):

The heatmap shows how income level correlates with cigarette use frequency. It reveals that lower-income individuals tend to smoke more frequently, highlighting a significant socio-economic disparity in tobacco use, which is crucial for formulating interventions targeted at lower-income groups.

## What form do you envision your final deliverable taking? (An article incorporating the images? A poster? An infographic?)
The final deliverable will likely take the form of an article incorporating these visualizations along with analysis and commentary on the trends in tobacco use in the U.S.
